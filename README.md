# DSA Problem Practice in C++

ðŸš€ **Just Started!** This repository is my journey of practicing Data Structures and Algorithms problems in C++. I'm building this collection as I solve problems and prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## About

This repository documents my DSA learning journey through C++ problem solving. Starting from basic patterns and gradually building up to complex algorithms and data structures. Each solution includes detailed explanations and complexity analysis.

**Current Focus:** Building a solid foundation with pattern problems and basic concepts.

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed
- **Pattern Problems** - Various star patterns, number patterns, and character patterns

### ðŸ”„ Work in Progress
- Setting up the repository structure
- Planning problem categories and difficulty progression

### ðŸ“‹ Coming Soon
- Array problems
- String manipulation problems  
- Basic sorting and searching algorithms

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC 7.0+ or any modern C++ compiler
- **Text Editor/IDE**: VS Code, Code::Blocks, or any C++ compatible editor
- **Basic C++ Knowledge**: Understanding of basic syntax and concepts

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deveshjd/dsa-cpp-practice.git
cd dsa-cpp-practice
```

2. **Compile and run a solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to patterns folder
cd patterns

# Compile the pattern file
g++ -o patterns star-patterns.cpp

# Run the program
./patterns
```

## Problem Format

Each C++ solution follows this structure:

```cpp
/*
Problem: [Problem Name]
Category: [Pattern/Array/String/etc.]
Difficulty: [Beginner/Easy/Medium/Hard]

Problem Description:
[Brief description of what the problem asks for]

Approach:
[Explanation of the approach and logic used]

Time Complexity: O(?)
Space Complexity: O(?)
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Solution implementation
    
    // Test cases or examples
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Roadmap

This is my planned learning path. I'll update this as I progress:

### Phase 1: Foundations (Current)
- [x] **Patterns**: Star patterns, number patterns, character patterns
- [ ] **Basic Math**: Prime numbers, GCD/LCM, digit manipulation
- [ ] **Arrays**: Basic array operations, searching, two pointers

### Phase 2: Core Concepts  
- [ ] **Strings**: Pattern matching, palindromes, anagrams
- [ ] **Sorting**: Bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick sort
- [ ] **Searching**: Linear search, binary search and variations

### Phase 3: Data Structures
- [ ] **Linked Lists**: Single, double, circular linked lists
- [ ] **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation and applications
- [ ] **Trees**: Binary trees, BST, tree traversals

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics
- [ ] **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths
- [ ] **Dynamic Programming**: Classic DP problems
- [ ] **Backtracking**: N-Queens, Sudoku solver

### Phase 5: Interview Preparation
- [ ] **LeetCode Problems**: Easy to Medium level
- [ ] **Company-specific**: Popular interview questions
- [ ] **Mock Interviews**: Practice sessions

## How to Use

### For Learning:
1. Start with the `patterns/` folder to understand basic logic building
2. Read the problem description and approach before looking at the code
3. Try to implement your own solution first
4. Compare your approach with the provided solution
5. Analyze the time and space complexity

### For Practice:
1. Pick a category you want to focus on
2. Solve problems in increasing order of difficulty  
3. Time yourself to simulate interview conditions
4. Write clean, commented code

### Current Available Problems:

#### Patterns Category
- **Star Patterns**: Right triangle, pyramid, diamond patterns
- **Number Patterns**: Pascal's triangle, Floyd's triangle
- **Character Patterns**: Alphabetic patterns

*More problems will be added regularly as I progress through my learning journey.*

## C++ Tips for Beginners

### Essential Headers
```cpp
#include <iostream>    // For input/output
#include <vector>      // For dynamic arrays  
#include <string>      // For string operations
#include <algorithm>   // For sorting, searching
```

### Useful Patterns
```cpp
// Fast input/output
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);

// Common loop patterns
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Processing
}

// Nested loops for patterns
for(int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for(int j = 1; j <= cols; j++) {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```
