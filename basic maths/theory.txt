# Digit Concept : to find no. of digits in a number do following steps-
                    count=0;
                    while(num!=0){
                        num=num/10;
                        count++;
                    }


# Reverse a Number : reverse=0;
                    while(num!=0){
                        remainder=num%10;
                        num=num/10;
                        reverse= reverse*10 + remainder;
                    }


# Palindrome Number : Palindrome no. are the no. whose reverse is same as the original no.
                        reverse==original


#Armstrong Number : An Armstrong no. in which the sum of digits to the power no. of digits is equal to the original no.
                    -> let Number1 be a no. in which the no. of of digits is x

                    while(Number1!=0){
                    remainder = Number1%10;
                    int Number2 = Number2 + power(remainder,x)  //here x is the no. of digits in Number1
                    Number1=Number1/10;
                    }
                    if(Number2==Number1){
                     //the number is armstrong
                    }
